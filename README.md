## Overview

### The challenge 

#### Objectives

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

#### Solution
I didn't work on making the solution responsive because I purely wanted to focus on getting the design just right. I used mobile-first for this one and I think I've found a suitable approach. 

Furthermore, with this solution I tried using BEM.
